To install the mentioned Python packages (streamlit, openpyxl, spaCy, pyngrok) using PowerShell or Command Prompt, you can use the following commands:

### Using PowerShell:

1. *streamlit*:
   powershell
   pip install streamlit
   

2. *openpyxl*:
   powershell
   pip install openpyxl
   

3. *spaCy*:
   powershell
   pip install spacy
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   

4. *pyngrok*:
   powershell
   pip install pyngrok --upgrade
   

### Using Command Prompt (cmd):

1. *streamlit*:
   cmd
   pip install streamlit
   

2. *openpyxl*:
   cmd
   pip install openpyxl
   

3. *spaCy*:
   cmd
   pip install spacy
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   

4. *pyngrok*:
   cmd
   pip install pyngrok --upgrade
   

These commands will install each package and, in the case of spaCy, download the English model (en_core_web_sm) necessary for its functionalities. Make sure you have Python and pip installed and that they are added to your system's PATH variable for these commands to work correctly.
